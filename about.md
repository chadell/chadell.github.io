# About me

I would define myself as a passionate IT systems engineer with experience in the Internet ecosystem, where I have performed several roles such as team lead, devops and network engineer.

Either as manager or contributor, I enjoy facing professional challenges to support business development and product management, growing new ideas from scratch to mature services. Personally I'm goal/data-driven, proactive and honest.

My tech background include networking, security, coding and sysadmin skills, due being playing around with the transformation of IT from bare-metal to Cloud based platforms.
