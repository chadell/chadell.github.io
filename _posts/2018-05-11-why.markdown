Good question... I'm not absolutely sure, but I feel that starting a blog where I could **share some of the findings and insights** that my ongoings projects are teaching me, could be interesting to more people, nothing else.

Also, it would be great to use this blog to discuss about the points you have regarding my posts, so we **collaborate together** on this learning process. I encourage you to do so!

Personally, the topics I'm interested in are Networking, Automation, Coding, DevOps, Linux, Cloud, Containers, etc. a lot of buzzwords that have made me happy at work. So expect related topics here.

Let's see if I can start blogging periodically, but hopefully from time to time something turns up here ðŸ˜‰
